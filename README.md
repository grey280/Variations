# Variations

*Variations on the Theme of Life* is an interactive media piece premiered as part of a senior capstone project at Linfield College in the spring of 2018.

A full description [is available here](http://grey280.net/2018/06/variations-on-the-theme-of-life-2/). (If you're wondering about everything being named 'Mk', it's because that was an earlier name for the project, a few iterations of the concept ago.)
